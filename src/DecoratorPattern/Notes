Decorator design pattern


Base class with minimal feature is present
--> the decorator design pattern will add a wrapper on this base class
    and add its own more features.


Decorator pattern has 4 components

1. Component Interface
 --> Interface or Abstract class defining the methods that will be implemented.

2. Component implementation
    --> The basic implementation of the component interface

3. Decorator
   --> Decorator class implements the component interface and it has a HAS-A relationship
       with the component interface.
       the component variable should be accessible to the child decorator classes, so we will
       make this variable protected.

4. Concreate Decorators
    --> Extending the base decorator functionality and modifying the component behaviour accordingly.
